# DarkBoard

DarkBoard is a dark [Espresso][esp] theme made to imitate the [Textmate][txtm]'s 'blackboard' theme, by Johannes of [Carnot Interactive][carnot].

I really tried to get the colors and feel to be as close to what I use in TextMate as possible. it is not 100% perfect due to some limitations in Espresso styling engine.

This version provides simple support for HTML, CSS and JS.
